## 🔬 Recent Contribution: *Hypertensive Urgency Book Chapter*

📖 I contributed to a published book on **Hypertensive Urgency**, addressing:

> **Severe Asymptomatic Hypertension**:  
> Hypertensive urgency (severely elevated blood pressure without acute end-organ damage) can usually be managed in outpatient clinics without emergency referral. Rather than prompt reduction, a **stepwise approach with oral antihypertensives** is safer. There are no universal protocols, so **clinical judgment remains essential**.

This work reflects my engagement in **healthcare process improvement and decision-making support**.
